# FurryCrossroadsAPI
API 2.0 Meant to be written in an open source and secure way.


### The current version implements token auth as well as logging.
This is to allow an east way to generate new tokens and authenticate them.
This will allow us to give functionality of the api to different applications
of Furry Crossroads. Future versions will have more features to support different
ways of interacting with Furry Crossroads.
